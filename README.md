# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This project performs an analysis of unemployment data using Python. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of people who are unemployed out of the total labor force, and it provides valuable insights into the economic health of a country. This analysis is especially relevant due to the increase in unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the unemployment rate data over a specified period and visualize trends. Weâ€™ll perform data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to understand changes in the unemployment rate and derive insights from it.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on unemployment rates over time. It includes columns such as:

- **Date**: The date on which the data was recorded.
- **Unemployment Rate**: The unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labor force.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure

- **Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes:

1. **Loading and Cleaning Data**: Checking for missing values and ensuring data is ready for analysis.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Plotting the unemployment rate over time to observe trends.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating the average unemployment rate.
4. **Distribution Visualization**: Displaying the distribution of unemployment rates.

## Results

The project provides insights into how the unemployment rate has changed over time, highlighting any significant trends or outliers.
